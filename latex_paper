\section*{Literature Review}

%P1: Epidemiology paragraph, aka "alcohol is bad for you and is common among undergrads"

Alcohol use is incredibly common on college campuses \cite{johnstonetal2016}. However, regular use of alcohol is associated with numerous short-term and long-term adverse health effects which can range in severity from a mild hangover to cancer, cirrhosis, and/or death \cite{kahleretal2004, rehmetal2009}. Moreover, heavy alcohol use as an undergradaute is associated with heavy drinking in adulthood \cite{jennison2004}. Thus, because alcohol use is both highly prevalent and associated with adverse health effects, undergradaute alcohol use remains of large public health concern.

%P2: Anxiety as a reason for use - transition to highlighting specifically stats anxiety.

Previous research has explored reasons undergraduates engage in alcohol use, and one of the common reasons is to cope with feelings of anxiety \cite{whitehingson2013, kasseletal2000, oharesherrer2000}. Whereas there are an uncountable number of reasons undergraduate students may experience anxiety, one nearly universal event among undergradaute students which is also likely to induce anxiety is taking a statistics course \cite{dunn2000, onwuegbuziewilson2003, sizemorelewandowski2009, smith2014, connersetal1998, onwuegbuzie2004, onwuegbuzie1999, kunickikuruppumullagedonundrev}. Almost all undergradaute majors require a statistics course as part of general education requirements, but many fields (e.g. psychology, public health) require advanced statistical training (i.e., multiple courses) for students to be successful in their fields \cite{ordetal2016, hayatetal2017}.
