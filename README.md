PHP 2530: All the Bae-sian Ladies
Literature Review

Alcohol use is common on college campuses and has health risks.
Overall, trends indicate that Western college  students drink more heavily at the beginning of each semester. 
Alcohol use is response to stress/anxiety is common.
Statistics anxiety is associated with alcohol use, over and above generic forms of anxiety. However, nearly all students need to take at least one statistics class as a general education requirement.
Purpose of this study is to model alcohol use at the start of the semester in which students are enrolled in an introductory statistics course. Comparisons are made using bae-sian multiple regression and frequentist multiple regression.

Methods

Participants (N = ???), % women % white, age. 
Materials - describe measures used.
Procedure - gave ‘em extra credit to take an online survey during the first two weeks of class.
Data analysis plan - explain bae-sian modeling approach here. For lame-quentist, just cite out to Kutner or some other MR book (Cohen et al?)
Model fitting assessments for bae-sian model to insure convergence and data replicability
Bayesian method for imputation of missing data 
 
Results

Descriptive table of characteristics 
Bae-sian first, lame-quentist second. See link below for recommended steps.

Possible Full Model:

Alcohol Use ~ Anxiety, Quant Anxiety, Stress, Depression, Drug Screener, Expected Grade, GPA, Gender, Race/Ethnicity, Age, Student Status, Pell Grant, Quant Course
Could consider a math attitudes or statistics attitude question? 

Use Baye’s factor to compare models 

Use backwards elimination for lame-quentist, marginal inclusion probabilities for bae-sian to determine a final model.

Can test predictive power of the model using Fall 2017 data?


Discussion

Re-state results in plain english, focus mainly on which model was retained.
Integrate our findings with the extant literature. What did we replicate? What did we not? What is new about our paper? 
Limitations (mainly white, mainly women, no comparison group not in a stats class)
Future directions (get a drink after this paper is submitted)
